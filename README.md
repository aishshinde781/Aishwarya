 3.Introduction
  Recommendation systems are computer programs that suggest recommendations to users depending on a variety of criteria.

   These systems estimate the most likely product that consumers will buy and that they will be interested in. Netflix, Amazon, and other companies use recommender  systems to help their users find the right product or movie for them.
	 
 There are 2 types of recommendation systems.

 1. Content-based Filtering : These suggest recommendations based on the item metadata (movie, product, song, etc). Here, the main idea is if a user likes an item, then the user will also like items similar to it.
2. Collaboration-based Filtering : These systems make recommendations by grouping the users with similar interests. For this system, metadata of the item is not required. 

4.Technical Acpects
This project is divided into two part:

1. Training a machine learning model using numpy
2. Building and hosting a Streanlit web app on Heroku.
